# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

## Overview
This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built to practice and apply knowledge of **factory functions** and **Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)** in JavaScript. The code is designed to be modular and maintainable, with a clear separation of game logic and UI functionality.
